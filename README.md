# Amiibo Info Lister

## Overview

The Amiibo Info Lister is a web application that allows users to enter an Amiibo name and fetch detailed information about it from the Amiibo API. Users can view the amiibo's name, game series, amiibo series, tail, type, and an image, all presented in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Search for amiibo by name.
- Display amiibo information, including series and type.
- Show an image of the amiibo.

## Files

1. **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
2. **`styles.css`**: The CSS file that styles the web page, including layout and visual design.
3. **`App.js`**: The main React component that manages state and fetches data from the Amiibo API.
4. **`Entry.js`**: The component that handles user input for amiibo names.
5. **`Info.js`**: The component that displays the fetched amiibo data.
6. **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application that renders the `App` component.

## Criticism Addressed

- **No Flex or Grid**: I added flex and grid to the styles.css giving it proper alignment as a webpage
- **No ReadMe**: I added a README which you are in fact seeing right now :)
- **No Title in Index**: I added the <title> with the Amiibo Info Lister name to it
